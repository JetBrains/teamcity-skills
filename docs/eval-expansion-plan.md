# Bounded evaluation expansion

## Objective and evidence

Obtain three to five additional fully passing skill cases and measure their
baseline arms under identical conditions. A local grader test is not a Claude
evaluation, a simulated build is not a live first-green build, and a skill pass
is not automatically a skill win. Keep every failed or tied observation.

## Execution order

1. Validate the three stateful queue contracts and positive/negative grader
   tests locally. State lives in the runner, not an agent-editable result file.
2. Run a bounded skill/baseline pilot for each selected case. Start with one
   pair rather than a large batch. Existing configuration pilots may run while
   the new fixture contracts are being verified.
3. Inspect only safe results, targeted build metadata, and published reports.
   Fix demonstrated harness/skill defects; do not change a live evaluated
   agent's target configuration. A changed harness/case starts a new pair.
4. Qualify promising cases with at least three scored samples per arm on the
   same harness, contract, tool mode and agent profile. Report ties as ties.
5. Keep new contracts draft until evidence has been reviewed; publish the
   result/check/time/cost comparison without traces or private target IDs.

## Selected cases

| Case | Environment | Required outcome |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `queued-missing-os-family-recovery` | Stateful CLI simulation | Discover the absent OS-family key, replace only the selector using an observed relevant capability, validate/read back, confirm compatibility and finish one verification. |
| `queued-unresolved-script-parameter-recovery` | Stateful CLI simulation | Repair unresolved shell-variable substitution without weakening Maven verification or artifact publication. |
| `queued-busy-compatible-agent` | Stateful CLI simulation | Establish compatibility and wait for the original run, without changing configuration, canceling or queueing a duplicate. |
| `spring-boot-demo-gradle-testcontainers-pipeline` | Live configuration only | Preserve build/test separation, generation tasks, runtime/Docker requirements and per-job outputs. |
| `spring-boot-kotlin-gradle-java25-pipeline` | Live configuration only | Configure the declared JDK 25 container and Gradle verification without requiring a preinstalled host JDK 25. |

The existing `queued-no-compatible-agent` remains a separate diagnosis-only
contract; it does not prove repair. The three new cases deliberately share a
neutral task request: the cause and correct action must come from observation.

## Boundaries

- CLI-only, same model/configuration and per-case timeout for both arms.
- Initial budgets: 300 seconds per simulated case, 900 seconds per live
  configuration case. Record the budget in the comparison profile.
- The fixture advances virtual queue state through bounded observations; no
  target cloud agent or real two-minute sleep is needed.
- New fixture results explicitly carry `evaluationEnvironment: simulated`.
- No source changes, removal of tests/artifacts, speculative retries or manual
  intervention can turn a failing evaluated run into a pass.
- Preserve unrelated local work. Use approved delivery (a scoped personal
  patch or an explicitly authorized commit/push), and label patch profiles so
  different harness contents are not combined under the same base Git SHA.
- Do not run full KMP/Testcontainers first-green builds as part of this batch.

## Fixture acceptance tests

Exercise successful repair and unchanged busy-agent completion, missing-key
case changes, requirements removal, source changes, build weakening, missing
validation/read-back/compatibility, duplicate starts, unbounded watches and
late diagnosis. A failed or timed-out agent exit must never become a pass,
even if intermediate checks were green.
