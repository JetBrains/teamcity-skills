# Build Step Selection

Choose TeamCity build steps that match the project technology and the active
TeamCity server's supported capabilities.

## Rules

- Prefer dedicated TeamCity runner or pipeline step types for primary
  build/test/package work when they are available.
- Use a generic script step only for project-specific glue, unsupported
  operations, or shell logic that would be less clear as a dedicated runner.
- Validate runner names, fields, and pipeline schema against the active server
  or existing configuration when they are not already known.
- Preserve checked-in CI intent. If the repository already describes multiple
  jobs or container validation, do not collapse that shape without a reason.
- Prefer the smallest configuration that proves the build, tests, and expected
  packaging or container checks work.

## Technology Defaults

- Gradle: when the live Pipeline schema exposes `type: gradle`, use the Gradle
  runner for primary Gradle build, test, and package tasks. Set its `tasks`
  property from the repository's verified Gradle tasks. Do not substitute a
  generic script merely because schema validation does not validate every
  runner-specific property. When the repository declares an exact JDK, require
  an agent/image that offers it and set job-level `env.JAVA_HOME` to the same
  discovered server-managed installation; do not rely on the agent's default
  Java. Use a script only for non-Gradle glue that the Gradle runner cannot
  express.
- Maven: prefer a Maven runner for Maven goals.
- Node.js: prefer a Node.js or npm-capable runner when the schema exposes one.
- .NET: prefer a .NET runner when available.
- Docker: prefer a Docker runner when the schema exposes one; otherwise keep
  container validation as a clear script-based job instead of dropping it.
- Python, Go, Rust, and other stacks: use dedicated runners when the active
  server exposes them; otherwise use the project's standard command in a script
  step.

## Output

When reporting the final setup, mention why each primary step type was chosen,
especially when a script step was used instead of a dedicated runner.
